        <p>From learning both inside and out of academics: I've a strong foundation in OOP, App and Web development, Mathmatics and Logic
            Computer Architecture, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Game Development. Java's my bread and butter - we've known eachother
            5~ years, but you'll find me proficient with C++, C, Python, HTML, CSS, and JS with React. Below is a complete list of what I've

                <li>Formal logic</li>
                <li>Set and graph theory</li>
            </ul>
